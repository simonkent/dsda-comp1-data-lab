# Data Science First Year Data Lab Repository

This repository accompanies the database labs.

There are two Jupyter notebooks, 1. DatabaseBasics and 2. RemoteDataLab.

There is also a python programm, `CreateTyreDB.py` which loads data from `Car_Tyres_Dataset.csv` and creates a database on a local SQL Server.

I have also included the database scripts `multi_table_tyre_DB.txt` to convert the single tabled tyres db into a multi-table version.  You should be able to execute these SQL commands using the MySQLWorkbench, or directly on the `mysql` client on your virtual machine.  Have a play and see what works for you.
