# Data Science First Year Data Lab Repository

This repository accompanies the database labs.

There are two Jupyter notebooks, DatabaseBasics and RemoteDataLab.

There is also a python programm, `CreateTyreDB.py` which loads data from `Car_Tyres_Dataset.csv` and creates a database on a local SQL Server.
