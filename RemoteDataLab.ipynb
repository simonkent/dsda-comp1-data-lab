    "Previously, we worked on our own machines, or a virtual desktop to connect to a remote database.  This database had a publicly available internet port 3306 to allow us to connect to MySQL.  As explained previousy, this is a huge security risk. In this lab we are going to be connecting to a remote linux machine running in the cloud.  Because we want things to be secure, we need to prevent unnecessary access to these kinds of machines.  We also don't want to install complex graphical user interfaces on them.  They just take up disk space, memory and processing power.\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore need to learn how to connect to systems like this, and transfer files to and from them.  We are going to need to use some way of connecting securely, and running software and manipulating files usign the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "As most of us are very used to using shiny GUIs these days, it may take you a while to become familiar with this way of working, but once you do you will find that the command line can sometimes be a much more efficient way of getting things done.\n",

    "As previously, you will each run into your own difficulties based on your individual machine, how open it is, your networking infrastructure at home an work.  When you have these difficulties, don't see it as a barrier to learning, but rather as an opportunity to learn.\n",
